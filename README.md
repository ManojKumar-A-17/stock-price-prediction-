# Netflix Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements various machine learning models to predict Netflix (NFLX) stock prices. The project includes implementations of four different machine learning algorithms to analyze and forecast stock market trends.

## Models Implemented
1. **Linear Regression (LR)**
   - File: `NFLX(LR).ipynb`
   - A basic regression model to establish linear relationships between features and stock prices

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - File: `NFLX2(KNN).ipynb`
   - A non-parametric method for classification and regression

3. **Random Forest (RF)**
   - File: `NFLX3(RF).ipynb`
   - An ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - File: `NFLX4(SVM).ipynb`
   - A powerful supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression

## Dataset
- File: `NFLX.csv`
- Contains historical Netflix stock data
- Size: 73KB
- Records: 1010

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter notebooks, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment
4. Run the cells to train and evaluate the models

## Results
The project implements four different machine learning models to predict Netflix stock prices. Each model can be run independently to analyze and compare their performance in stock price prediction.
